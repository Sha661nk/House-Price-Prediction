# House-Price-Prediction

Welcome to the 'House-Price-Prediction' repository, a comprehensive project aimed at predicting house prices in the King County region of the United States. This endeavor is not just a demonstration of applying various regression models but a deep dive into the intricacies of real estate data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview:
King County, with its diverse range of properties and dynamic real estate market, presents a unique opportunity for data-driven analysis and prediction. This project encapsulates a series of steps, each critical to understanding and forecasting house prices with accuracy and precision.

### Key Components:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initially, we conduct an extensive EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies in the dataset. This phase is crucial for gaining insights into the factors that influence house prices in King County and guides our subsequent modeling strategies.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Recognizing the impact of various features on house prices, we delve into feature engineering. This process includes creating new features, transforming existing ones, and selecting the most relevant features that contribute to the accuracy of our predictions.

3. **Model Selection and Comparison:** A range of regression models are employed to tackle this prediction problem. Each model is carefully chosen and evaluated based on its performance, with a keen focus on achieving the highest possible accuracy. The models include but are not limited to:
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting Machines

### Results and Comparisons:
The effectiveness of each model is meticulously analyzed and compared. We provide detailed insights into the performance metrics of each algorithm, discussing their strengths and limitations in the context of our specific dataset and prediction goals.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from publicly available records and represents a comprehensive collection of housing transactions in King County. It includes a wide range of features such as house size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and more, making it ideal for a multifaceted predictive analysis.

## Getting Started:
For those interested in exploring this project further, we provide a complete setup guide, including data acquisition, preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation procedures. The repository is structured to facilitate easy understanding and implementation, whether you're a seasoned data scientist or a beginner in the field.
